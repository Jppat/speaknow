Advancements in technology have allowed people to utilize machine learning techniques such as automatic speech recognition (ASR). ASR is a technology that allows computers to automatically recognize and transcribe spoken language , and it has made significant advances in recent years. Studies have been conducted and results show the potential of technology-based reading tutors in improving reading skills. However, it can still be challenging to achieve high levels of accuracy for some languages and accents, especially those that are underrepresented in ASR training data. This paper, therefore, aims to develop a system to detect the acceptability of an input reading speech relative to a reference speech in Hiligaynon. The system will use the open source speech recognition toolkit — Kaldi, to build the acoustic model and to perform the viterbi-forced alignment process to determine the input speech’s similarity against the reference speech.
